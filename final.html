        is chocolate produced in Switzerland. Switzerland's chocolates have
        earned an international reputation for high quality with many famous
        international chocolate brands. Switzerland is particularly renowned for
        its milk chocolate, the most consumed type of chocolate. In 1875, a
        Swiss confectioner, Daniel Peter, developed the first solid milk
        chocolate using condensed milk, which had been invented by Henri Nestl√©,
        who was Peter's neighbour in Vevey.[1][2] In addition to milk, a wide
        variety of ingredients other than cocoa are used to make the most
        popular chocolate bars. They notably include nuts (mostly hazelnuts and
        almonds) and dried fruits (raisins).
